# Exam Thesis
## Description
>This is my my examination thesis for *IT-Högskolan*, where i studied *.NET fullstack development*. This project will be a divided into 3 parts to make a *resumé/CV CMS application*. 

The 3 parts my thesis project will be divided into are for showcasing my architectual and programming ability.
* The first part is the API connected to a database, i will call this the backend. 
* The second part will be the Admin panel (even though the admin panel is a frontend application it will be refered to as the admin panel). The panel will have CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to the database through the API. 
* The third part is the outward facing frontend, where my data will be displayed in a elegent way from the database through the API. The frontend will primarily only have read access depending on what features i have.

    Draw.io is a free and opensource flowchart making website and program that I used in mapping and planning diffirent processes such as database logic and general brainstorming. What makes it so good other then being free is the fact it let's users save flowcharts directly to their online repositories if they want to (and many other cloud services or locally). It is also nice thanks to the many possible ways to export the charts in.
