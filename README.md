# Exam Thesis
## Description
>This is my my examination thesis for *IT-HÃ¶gskolan* where i studied *.NET fullstack development*. This project will be a divided into 3 parts to make a *resume CMS website*. 

The 3 parts my thesis project will be divided into are for showcasing my architectual and programming ability.
* The first part is the API connected to a database, i will call this the backend. 
* The second part will be the Admin panel (even though the admin panel is a frontend application it will be refered to as the admin panel). The panel will have CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to the database through the API. 
* The third part is the outward facing frontend, where my data will be displayed in a elegent way from the database through the API. The frontend will primarily only have read access depending on what features i have.
